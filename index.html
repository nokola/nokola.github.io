This is how I made https://systemfailure.io:
The general idea:
Use GitHub for storing all files in nokola/blog
Use Hugo for building the static site from nokola/blog to nokola/nokola.github.io
Use GitHub Pages to specify that nokola/nokola.github.io will publish on https://systemfailure.io
Use Forestry.io
Test the final speed using https://testmysite.</span><div><span class="dib bg-moon-gray br--top br--right f7 hover-bg-light-silver link mt2 ph3 pv2">read more &gt;</span></div></span></span></a></article></div><div class="relative w-100 mt1 mb4"><article class="bb b--black-10 word-wrap"><a href=/post/windows-8-apps-performance-helper-speed-at-a-glance/ class=main-link><h1 class="f4 title-font lh-title pl4 pt4 pb3 mb2 mt2">Windows 8 apps performance helper: Speed at a glance</h1><span class="flex flex-column pa4 pb8 pt0"><span class=w-100><p class="f7 pt3 pb3 mv0 mid-gray"><span>Nov 28, 2012</span>

The library has a lot of potential for Silverlight games. It does MP3 decoding in managed code and exposes some cool controls like Pitch, Echo. Duet is my favorite. I’m also a Transformers fan and like how Duet makes explosion and swoosh sounds sound “Transformerish”.
I believe it should solve the “short sound” and “looping music” issues with Silverlight without any problem :).

This is the reason why I haven’t done anything public in Silverlight recently. I’ve been also experimenting with the new Expression Blend and Phone 7 stuff.
Note that I started from 0 (zero) :) about 2 months ago, all by myself so coming from “Marry Had a Little Lamb” to the above music was definitely a trip and fun!</span><div><span class="dib bg-moon-gray br--top br--right f7 hover-bg-light-silver link mt2 ph3 pv2">read more &gt;</span></div></span></span></a></article></div><div class="relative w-100 mt1 mb4"><article class="bb b--black-10 word-wrap"><a href=/post/simple-functions-for-html-interop/ class=main-link><h1 class="f4 title-font lh-title pl4 pt4 pb3 mb2 mt2">Simple Functions for HTML Interop</h1><span class="flex flex-column pa4 pb8 pt0"><span class=w-100><p class="f7 pt3 pb3 mv0 mid-gray"><span>Apr 3, 2010</span></p><span class="f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height nested-links">I used the below functions on several occasions to transfer data between a server and Silverilght application.

Particle Buzz
This effect has a lot of potential, since it’s the first displacement effect in EasyPainter based on image. Currently, it just uses random noise (Random.Next(256) for the R,G,B and 255 for the A channels).</span><div><span class="dib bg-moon-gray br--top br--right f7 hover-bg-light-silver link mt2 ph3 pv2">read more &gt;</span></div></span></span></a></article></div><div class="relative w-100 mt1 mb4"><article class="bb b--black-10 word-wrap"><a href=/post/easypainter-source-pack-3-adorners-mouse-cursors-and-frames/ class=main-link><h1 class="f4 title-font lh-title pl4 pt4 pb3 mb2 mt2">EasyPainter Source Pack 3: Adorners, Mouse Cursors and Frames</h1><span class="flex flex-column pa4 pb8 pt0"><span class=w-100><p class="f7 pt3 pb3 mv0 mid-gray"><span>Mar 17, 2010</span></p><span class="f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height nested-links">Adorners went a long way since their first release few months ago.

The new Blood shader works only on skin colors. To use it, you have to use the selection brush to select skin tones from the image. Here is the Watercolor shader. It's very subtle, but I think it looks nice nevertheless.

I'm not 100% sure if this is the fastest way, but it's definitely worth it (fast). There are 2 other possible ways to do fast tiling:
Do it manually or "hardcoded" - if your tile will never change, just do it in any image editor and then display the tiled result using an Image tag Display several images next to each other - relatively harder, but might end up being faster than the pixel shader (this is just a speculation on my side since I haven't tested it yet, but it is worth a try).</span><div><span class="dib bg-moon-gray br--top br--right f7 hover-bg-light-silver link mt2 ph3 pv2">read more &gt;</span></div></span></span></a></article></div><div class="relative w-100 mt1 mb4"><article class="bb b--black-10 word-wrap"><a href=/post/appeal-for-donations-keep-games-going-not-ads/ class=main-link><h1 class="f4 title-font lh-title pl4 pt4 pb3 mb2 mt2">Appeal for Donations - Keep Games Going, Not Ads!</h1><span class="flex flex-column pa4 pb8 pt0"><span class=w-100><p class="f7 pt3 pb3 mv0 mid-gray"><span>Dec 20, 2009</span></p><span class="f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height nested-links">Please take some time to read this appeal completely and eventually donate.

Edit Dec, 15: Andrej Tozon created an updated source supporting Behaviours (and drag-drop without code in Blend). Here's a link to his version. Thanks Andrej!
This&nbsp;is work in progress,&nbsp;but the base functionality is there and stable!

A desktop-like RPG Chinese game in Silverlight: http://silverfuture.cn/&nbsp;
It's 10.7 MB but worth the wait! It's in Chinese.
I'm sure in future versions it can be much less (e.g. Shock is 17 MB, but 680KB in order to play with the rest being downloaded as you play)
And!! The source code is here: http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/QXGameEngine
Some notable things (other than the graphics, implementation and overall coolness):

Bump mapping is an effect that makes "plain" textures - such as stone wall, appear bumpy under a light.
Even for a 2D game, bump mapping has a lot of uses. For example, if you're building a space shooter, it would be 10000 times cooler if lights from explosions illuminate the ship, showing it's ridged surfaces.
I've seen the effect used in games in the main menu as well, where the light of the cursor illuminated a rough surface.</span><div><span class="dib bg-moon-gray br--top br--right f7 hover-bg-light-silver link mt2 ph3 pv2">read more &gt;</span></div></span></span></a></article></div><div class="relative w-100 mt1 mb4"><article class="bb b--black-10 word-wrap"><a href=/post/openid-login-for-aspnet/ class=main-link><h1 class="f4 title-font lh-title pl4 pt4 pb3 mb2 mt2">OpenID Login for ASP.NET</h1><span class="flex flex-column pa4 pb8 pt0"><span class=w-100><p class="f7 pt3 pb3 mv0 mid-gray"><span>Dec 2, 2009</span></p><span class="f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height nested-links">And, eventually, Silverlight :)

Edit: just fixed a bug reported where the initial assesment woult be 0 msec, thanks Morten for reporting it!
The answer is easy: run as many threads as the CPU cores. For example, on Dual Core, you should run 2 threads and on Quad Core 4 threads.</span><div><span class="dib bg-moon-gray br--top br--right f7 hover-bg-light-silver link mt2 ph3 pv2">read more &gt;</span></div></span></span></a></article></div><div class="relative w-100 mt1 mb4"><article class="bb b--black-10 word-wrap"><a href=/post/best-way-to-clear-writeablebitmap/ class=main-link><h1 class="f4 title-font lh-title pl4 pt4 pb3 mb2 mt2">Best Way To Clear WriteableBitmap?</h1><span class="flex flex-column pa4 pb8 pt0"><span class=w-100><p class="f7 pt3 pb3 mv0 mid-gray"><span>Nov 11, 2009</span></p><span class="f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height nested-links">If you're doing a lot of custom drawing using WriteableBitmap (e.g. full screen game), it will be extremely important to be able to clear the WriteableBitmap or "screen" quickly.

How about this loop that draws the line:[code:c#]

for (int i = 0; i &lt; lenY; i++) {

}[/code]
40FPS * 10000 lines = 400,000 lines/sec
