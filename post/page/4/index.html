        Someone Said it Was Impossible: Hue Shift in Pixel Shader 2.0 (EasyPainter, Silverlight)

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I read somewhere online that Hue changes can't be done in pixel shader 2.0, due to limitation of 64 instructions per slot.
Here's the sample that proves otherwise:

 Indeed the RGB-to-HSL-to-RGB conversion takes about 100 instructions in its typical implementation. PS 2.0 which is the shader model supported by Silverlight 3 only allows for 64 arithmetic instructions, as outlined in this comparison between pixel shaders on Wikipedia

      I'm very happy to publish the EasyPainter source code pack. The controls in the pack are optimized for usability, speed and size.
All of them have been succesfully used in real-life apps which is the best way to test if something works.

Here's a live demo:
 This pack contains the following controls:
 Color Picker - feature complete control that allows to pick any color, transparency or&nbsp;type in&nbsp;hex color Editable, auto-formatting slider - if you want to give the user the ability to quickly choose values with previews, this control is for you.

      Edit Nov 21, 2011: changed 256/a to 255/a due to Gert’s comment – thanks Gert!
The first time I tried saving WriteableBitmap to png, the transparencies didn't look right. The color was &quot;washed out&quot; and replaced with gray:
&#160;Moreover: Let's say you wanted to set a half-opaque red pixel color inside a WriteableBitmap.
To my biggest surprise this didn't work:
bitmap.Pixels[i] = (255 &lt;&lt; 24) + (255 &lt;&lt; 16)
I got a redder pixel than expected!

      If you ever needed to save a WriteableBitmap to an image&nbsp;file without too much hassle (e.g. for debugging purposes), you could use this simple source code to save it as TGA and then open with Paint.NET:
From Wikipedia: "TGA files are in widespread use due to their simplicity and ease of implementation and lack of encumbering patents."

      Here's a small code snippet that allows you to calculate any pixel shader and get the output into a WriteableBitmap!

Stream stream = Application.GetResourceStream(new Uri("SilverlightApplication1;component/Images/test.jpg", UriKind.Relative)).Stream;
WriteableBitmap result = new WriteableBitmap(1, 1); // avoid creating intermediate BitmapImage
result.SetSource(stream);
Image image = new Image();
image.Effect = new BlurEffect(); // any pixel shader effect
image.Source = result; // set the image to the original
result.Render(image, null);
result.Invalidate(); // render the pixel shader

      This post is a call for initial feedback, before&nbsp;I go deeper into coding and stuff, just to make sure I'm not missing anything and capture cool ideas...
I've been working on a new game recently, and thought it would be really nice to have some cutscenes in the game.
Here's a sample frame such a scene:&nbsp;
Obviously, the above frame is not too advanced, but it looks pretty exciting and fun to create, especially when combined with the right soundtrack

      Getting your backgrounds quickly is very important for games, especially at startup time when you're downloading a lot of stuff anyway (like menu buttons, simple effects, such as explosions and other things that didn't make it into the "core" xap to reduce initial load time).
Since you are full screen, it is a good idea to detect the resolution (that would be the ActualWidth and ActualHeight properties of your root control) and programatically return a suitable sized background.
