      Did you know that by default you see only ratings for your marketplace? I didn’t, and was very amazed to find out my apps have more reviews and ratings than what shows up in my phone marketplace or Zune window.
Using App Ratings, you can now view the ratings by market on a single screen and access reviews in all markets. Search the marketplace for “App Ratings” or click here to get the app

Yes! See the 1-minute intro HD video of the drawing app below. In this version, you can add makeup to someone’s face, change eye color (or other colors). It also comes with all-new fur smudge, and color reveal/hide brushes as well as rainbow mode for all existing Fantasia brushes.

 Download source code (note: I added the free purple “star spiral thingie”.png – see steps 5-6 below - used for the above effect to the source code download)
I tried to make a “clean” source code (read: slow, not optimized at all) for the sake of the tutorial and because I didn’t have time to speed it up yet.

      Yes! I just released support for new type of filters in Fantasia that I called Creations. The first, Nebula Creation, allows me do to starry background images like this (source code below):
Update: shortly after releasing the source code I noticed the nebula image was fixed (only the opacity mask was varying), fixed it and uploaded again.

      Update Oct 27, 2010: Thanks to Shai Rubinshtein (see comments) for pointing out an issue with AALine(), source code updated below and in link.
Some (long) time ago I decided to port Fantasia Painter to Windows Phone 7. When I ran it on an actual device (my friend’s, no I don’t have it yet unfortunately) last week, updating the screen while painting had about 0.5 second lag. This lag is quite unacceptable for a painting app.

      The reason I didn’t post for so long: I was waiting for the public announcement of 19 new job openings in the Expression team!
The jobs include QA (Software Design Engineer in Test), PM (Program Manager) and Dev (Software Design Engineer), Writer and few more. You can apply even if you’re not in the US. I moved to this team about 2 months ago. I’m currently part of the core/shared graphics team, which is a nice place to be (knock on wood:)) for a person who likes developing samples and working with technologies and devices such as WPF, Silverlight, Windows Phone 7 and web site stuff :)

 New Rainbow brush makes ultra cool smooth color transitions, based on stroke direction  EasyPainter includes all Fantasia brushes and is now named Fantasia!  Fantasia is out of Beta! There is new, enhanced Undo functionality, improved interface.  Smear procedural brush effect makes for reallistic paint “feel” when drawing   Details below:

Here’s what I built tonight – a drawing tool that utilizes procedural brushes to enable almost everyone to create fluffy rabbits like this:
 

Note that it took me about 2 minutes to “build the rabbit”. I’m sure someone else can do better.

        Coolest Silverlight Sound Library for Games I’ve Seen Yet

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Quite amazing demo: http://prefix.teddywino.com/post/SilverlightMediaKitLiveDemo.aspx&#160;
The library has a lot of potential for Silverlight games. It does MP3 decoding in managed code and exposes some cool controls like Pitch, Echo. Duet is my favorite. I’m also a Transformers fan and like how Duet makes explosion and swoosh sounds sound “Transformerish”.
I believe it should solve the “short sound” and “looping music” issues with Silverlight without any problem :). The biggest coolness though is that you can now simulate doppler effects and have more “rich” sound in smaller package (for example, by keeping only one explosion.

      Yes! For the last month or so I have been studying the piano. Here are my first 2 pieces:

This is the reason why I haven’t done anything public in Silverlight recently. I’ve been also experimenting with the new Expression Blend and Phone 7 stuff.
Note that I started from 0 (zero) :) about 2 months ago, all by myself so coming from “Marry Had a Little Lamb” to the above music was definitely a trip and fun!
