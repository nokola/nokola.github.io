      I used the below functions on several occasions to transfer data between a server and Silverilght application.
The blog integration between .NET Blog Engine and my Silverlight navigation on top of this site is done using this method.
You can see the blog title &ldquo;You Had Me At Hello World&rdquo; in the Silverlighg navigation window on top.
The interop is easy and I tried it in IE, Firefox, Chrome, Opera. Define an HTML like this:

Particle Buzz
This effect has a lot of potential, since it’s the first displacement effect in EasyPainter based on image. Currently, it just uses random noise (Random.Next(256) for the R,G,B and 255 for the A channels).

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Adorners went a long way since their first release few months ago. They integrate with zoom now, have more options for controlling functionality and can use a shared &quot;cursor plane&quot; for displaying mouse cursors consistently across your application. Extensibility is improved allowing definition of custom adorner frames. There are 7 custom cursors and 4 custom frames to get you started :)

I use the same adorner implementation in EasyPainter.

      There were several major bugfixes in EasyPainter controls and few updates. Here are the main two:
 Changing the color the first time when using the API in the color picker now works (heh :)). Editable slider has a new DisplayFormat property allowing you to override the format (e.g. DisplayFormat=&quot;X: 0.0&quot; – see below)  The sample is also moved to Visual Studio 2010 RC.
Here is a refresh of source pack 1 with the changes:

      I am playing with EasyPainter recently :) There are no new additions to the software (yet).
Here's how to apply a hair style to a lion.
Original:
 Hair styled:
 The original image is from: http://www.flickr.com/photos/wwarby/2404544591/ (search for &quot;lion&quot; in EasyPainter)
I'd say the second one looks way cooler, especially with the blue Raiden-like eyes. Raiden is the god of thunder from Mortal Kombat!
Effects used: Color shift for the eyes, followed by Brigthness.

      Yes! :) After spending about 1 hour last night, here are 10 more shaders in EasyPainter. Since I don't have time to write about each one now, here is a sample image leveraging a few:
Original:
 Manipulated:
  Zoom Motion in the lower left corner making the trees appear moving fast towards the viewer Ripples in the sea  Magnify to enlarge the cloud on the right of the image Pinch to change the shape of the lower coconuts Tint and Color Shift to change the color of the coconuts Sharpen on the houses in the backgroundto make the contrast with Zoom Motion stand out more Magnifier Lens to make the trunk of the palm thinner Life-Like Colors to reveal the missing colors   Shaders now have color pickers (such as Tint), and positions (such as Zoom Motion).

Original vs Zombie – can you figure out which one is which? :)
&#160; 
The new Blood shader works only on skin colors. To use it, you have to use the selection brush to select skin tones from the image. Here is the Watercolor shader. It's very subtle, but I think it looks nice nevertheless. If anyone has suggestions for improvements, including a proper name for this shader, since it is really subtle - please let me know!

      Yay! 2D and 3D noise in pixel shaders!
After tackling the Hue shader I decided to move to something even more interesting, Simplex noise.
You've probably heard of Perlin Noise, if not see Rene's post with realtime 3D noise here&nbsp;and also check out my Living Noise sample and Living Noise blog post .
The "Noise" can be used to make effects such as fire, water, marbles, smooth motion, hand-drawn UI, space travel effects, nebulas and a lot more!
