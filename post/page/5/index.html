        Fast Tile Brush in Silverlight, And Easiest Way to Shader Effects

      Here is one monster, tiled as 6&nbsp;monsters down here:
 This is actually 1 monster, tiled twice horizontally and 3 times vertically using a Silverlght Tile brush shader effect.

I'm not 100% sure if this is the fastest way, but it's definitely worth it (fast). There are 2 other possible ways to do fast tiling:
 Do it manually or "hardcoded" - if your tile will never change, just do it in any image editor and then display the tiled result using an Image tag Display several images next to each other - relatively harder, but might end up being faster than the pixel shader (this is just a speculation on my side since I haven't tested it yet, but it is worth a try).

      Please take some time to read this appeal completely and eventually donate.
I don't like ads, and there's high possibility that you don't too!
At the same time having an ad-sponsored web site means that ad programs "share" some of people's time (and time is money) spent on my site.
Should I force anyone of the thousands people who view this site to pay for ads? No, I shouldn't and that's one reason to make today's appeal.

This one is in pure C++, a completely glassy command prompt:

Usage  Download the source Glassy.zip (34.05 kb) and run Glassy\Debug\Glassy.exe, or compile and run. Run it as Administrator (right-click the .exe, Run as Administrator) Open command prompt and enjoy the glass!

This&nbsp;is work in progress,&nbsp;but the base functionality is there and stable!

      This is mind blowing!!
A desktop-like RPG Chinese game in Silverlight: http://silverfuture.cn/&nbsp;
It's 10.7 MB but worth the wait! It's in Chinese.
I'm sure in future versions it can be much less (e.g. Shock is 17 MB, but 680KB in order to play with the rest being downloaded as you play)
And!! The source code is here: http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/QXGameEngine
Some notable things (other than the graphics, implementation and overall coolness):
1. The map is made of PNG's&nbsp;sized 400x300, it is pre-drawn.

      Ah yes! Bump mapping is an effect that makes "plain" textures - such as stone wall, appear bumpy under a light.
Even for a 2D game, bump mapping has a lot of uses. For example, if you're building a space shooter, it would be 10000 times cooler if lights from explosions illuminate the ship, showing it's ridged surfaces.
I've seen the effect used in games in the main menu as well, where the light of the cursor illuminated a rough surface.

Here is the "hello world" OpenID login using DotNetOpenAuth.
If you don't know what's OpenID, it's a way to use your existing Google, Yahoo, AOL, Blogger and many more credentials (eventually Live too), to login to an OpenID website.
The source code allows you to login using Google, Yahoo, MyOpenID, or other provider and returns a state containing a friendly name and database unique ID of the user that is authenticated!
