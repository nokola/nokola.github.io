     <p>Imagine having all your links whenever you go available on your browser bar, without having to install any custom software like a toolbar.</p>

<p>Imagine going to a new pc and populating your links at your browser with 2 or 3 clicks, without installing software.</p>
<p>Is it possible? Yes it is! Read on, and then subscribe to my links if you wish!</p>
<p>I spent lot of time in the past trying to find a place to put my links into. The problems are:</p>
<ul>
<li>keeping favourites around is hard (OS reinstall, work vs home machines, etc)</li>
<li>People with similar interests as mine, cannot contribute to "my" links...then I can miss quite a bit</li>
</ul>
<p>So I decided to keep my links online. But keeping them online means I have to go to a site, then click the link...it's too much</p>
<p>Then it came to me: RSS link syndication! It allows a nice drop-down-like menu that keeps track of changes and so on automatically.</p>
<p>Please <a href="http://nokola.com/links/subscribe.axd">subscribe to my links</a>&nbsp;which point to resources and such.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the steps for Internet Explorer 8:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://nokola.com/links/subscribe.axd">Click here to subscribe</a></li>
<li>Click "Subscribe to this feed" and make sure "Add to Favourites Bar" is checked:</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="/2009%2f11%2fwalk1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Enjoy your new drop-down, auto-updateable, relevant (hopefully, if you have similar interests to me) links!</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="/2009%2f11%2fwalk2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The links are categorized and also show if they are Free (F), Paid ($), for Commercial (&copy;) or Personal (P) use.</p>
<p>Please make sure to contribute your own links&nbsp;at <a href="http://nokola.com/links">http://nokola.com/links</a>!</p>
<p>So if you want to remind yourself of that free-for-commercial-use graphics site you browsed last month, you can!</p>
<p>Please comment and leave feedback!</p>
