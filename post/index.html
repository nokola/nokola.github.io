      Windows 8 Apps have this nice awesome property that you can set in order to show framerate counters:
Application.Current.DebugSettings.EnableFrameRateCounter = true; 
Just call it in your MainPage() constructor after the InitializeComponent() call.
To make it easier to figure out which number is which, put this grid somewhere in your root grid on MainPage:
&lt;Grid HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Left&quot; VerticalAlignment=&quot;Top&quot;&#160; IsHitTestVisible=&quot;False&quot;&gt; &#160;&#160;&#160; &lt;Rectangle Fill=&quot;#88F4F4F5&quot; HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Left&quot; Height=&quot;91&quot; VerticalAlignment=&quot;Top&quot; Width=&quot;40&quot; Opacity=&quot;0.5&quot;/&gt; &#160;&#160;&#160; &lt;Rectangle Fill=&quot;#3F5B71FF&quot; HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Left&quot; Height=&quot;68&quot; VerticalAlignment=&quot;Top&quot; Width=&quot;43&quot; Margin=&quot;45,0,0,0&quot;/&gt; &#160;&#160;&#160; &lt;Rectangle Fill=&quot;#88F4F4F5&quot; HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Left&quot; Height=&quot;35&quot; VerticalAlignment=&quot;Top&quot; Width=&quot;79&quot; Opacity=&quot;0.

      Edit: Added NoDo/Mango switching as well. Simplified changes to .csproj files
How would you like to be able to switch from Free/Paid and NoDo/Mango&#160; for your Windows Phone 7 projects in VS?
&#160;&#160; 
Yes! This will switch my Fantasia Painter app from Paid to Free, and it’s just a build configuration change.
I’ve been using it for the past 6 months or so. Here’s how to do it:
 Open Configuration Manager and add a “Free – Release” and “Free – Debug”.

Noticed that BlogEngine.NET 2.5 supports Disqus. After upgrading I used this tool (http://ithoughthecamewithyou.com/post/Convert-BlogML-comments-to-XWR-for-Disqus.aspx) to move my comments over!
And also had to apply this BlogEngine Disqus Comment Count Fix
The last part I had to do was update scripts/blog.js to put the div.appendChild(p) below the (ul) in order for the rating text to appear as expected
showRating: function (container, id, raters, rating) { &#160;&#160;&#160; var div = document.

      Edit 2001/10/10: I noticed that I actually get InvalidOperationException on Mango (seems like all the time now, but I’m not 100% sure). Updated code in CaptureTask_Completed to check for this.
Rene had a great blog post about How to detect the Zune software about an year ago. Unfortunately, the method he describes no longer works in Mango.
Moreover, when you get the Cancel event from the PhotoChooserTask in Mango, neither OnNavigatingFrom nor OnNavigatedTo is called for your page.

      Finally, no spam! My blog was slowly becoming dysfunctional, after getting more than 2000 spam comments per day!
I moved to the new version 2.0 of http://dotnetblogengine.net last night, and it has super easy built in reCAPTCHA which stops spam and helps read books. Pretty cool! The reCAPTCHA settings are accessed by hovering over Tools and selecting Edit in .NET Blog Engine 2.0 – it was very hard and non-intuitive to find the setting, but once I did it worked like a charm!

      I’m releasing the App Rating app source code today, under MS-RL license (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/ms-rl). In summary, you can use the App Rating's source for commercial (even directly competitive) projects and are required to provide updates to the source code back to me and the community.
The nice part that you can get from AppRating’s code is the WebApi.cs class, which is optimized for network REST requests, dynamically changing priority of requests, cancelling, etc, and is very lightweight.

      I updated App Rating to have search for apps, show rating since last update, and be much faster. Unlike other similar rating apps on the marketplace, App Rating shows a single-screen per-market score so you can compare your app in different markets easily. To use, search the marketplace for “App Rating” or click here to get the app

Video of the new functionality:

Unless I get strong feedback for new features, I’m not planning to invest more in App Ratings.
