Thanks to few donations and some out-of-pocket money, I was able to buy back some of Shock's music.</p><ul><li>Each character has a theme song now. The new character - Old Man, is named after that guy that flies raindeers and distributes gifts through his Christmas distribution chain.</li><li>The music has new engine now, with "announcing" control (a popup that displays the song title with information).</li><li>Other improvements include sounds for everything - ball hit, shattering glass, etc. To make this work, I had to create an AutoPlay MediaElement for each mp3 and play it. There are few tricks here that you can use to minimize objects created and mem usage - code will follow!</li><li>New visual effects include "shatter" effect which is based on this: <a href=http://www.shinedraw.com/animation-effect/flash-vs-silverlight-colorful-fireworks/>http://www.shinedraw.com/animation-effect/flash-vs-silverlight-colorful-fireworks/</a>, with the following simple changes/improvements:<ul><li>Fireworks consist of 2 ellipses instead of 5 - speed optimization</li><li>The effect has "range" - e.g. you can make the dots appear everywhere on the brick, not just one point</li><li>The effect takes TimeSpan (e.g. 0.5 sec), and plays for a specific time, then the Canvas removes itself from it's parent. This allows to just add the effect anywhere and then start it and forget it. Nice and self-manageable :)</li></ul></li><li>Many speed improvements related to GPU and BitmapCache. For some weird reason, I've left the bitmap cache off many of the images before...most notably the background image that takes a lot of space</li></ul><p>I have few more improvements in the pipeline - mainly perf and resolving few minor issues (I doubt if anyone will notice most of them)</p><p>It is a busy Christmas :) I'll post some code from v3 of the game soon...first let's wrap it up.</p><p>Yes, the game is here: <a href=http://nokola.com/shock>http://nokola.com/shock</a></p><p>I strongly advise playing with the Old Man, as it provides the most festive experience! :)</p><p>Please let me know your opinion - does it play well? What do you think about it and what would you change or improve?</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Note: donations are still open, since the game hasn't paid for itself just yet and I'm planning&nbsp;more games&nbsp;:)</p></section><div class=mt5></div><div id=graphcomment></div><script type=text/javascript>window.graphcomment_id='nokola-blog';(function(){var gc=document.createElement('script');gc.type='text/javascript';gc.async=true;gc.src='https://graphcomment.com/js/integration.js';(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]||document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(gc);})();</script></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f7 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://systemfailure.io/>&copy; 2019 System Failure</a></div></footer><script src=https://systemfailure.io/dist/app.bundle.js async></script></body></html>
