The answer is easy: run as many threads as the CPU cores.

Here's an example from my box:</p><ul><li>1 thread:&nbsp;132 msec</li><li>2 threads:&nbsp;111 msec</li><li>4 threads:&nbsp;140 msec</li><li>8 threads:&nbsp;822 msec</li></ul><p>If you look at the above data, you can easily tell I'm running on a quad-core system, because jumping from 4 to 8 threads significanly increases the computational time needed (more than 1.8 times).</p><p>This is how to use the source code:</p><p>[code:c#]</p><p>int coreCount = PerformanceMeasure.GetCoreCount();</p><p>[/code]</p><p>You can call the above function from the UI thread.</p><p>There are also two tweaks in the code that allows it to run roughly at the same speed on all machines and run faster on single-core machines too:</p><ul><li>Once the core limit is hit, the algorithm stops. E.g. if you find that 4 threads take more than 1.8x the time as compared to 2 threads, this means you have 2 cores and there is no need to test with 8 threads</li><li>Before the main algorithm (above) starts, there is an estimation step, which calculates how many operations can be executed for 100 msec on 1 thread. This ensures that the assesment will run fast even on slow machines.</li></ul><p>Please comment! I would be interesting to know how well the algorithm works and if it detected your cores as you expected!</p></section><div class=mt5></div><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=nokola/blog issue-term=pathname label=comment theme=github-dark crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f7 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://systemfailure.io/>&copy; 2020 System Failure</a></div></footer><script src=https://systemfailure.io/dist/app.bundle.js async></script></body></html>
